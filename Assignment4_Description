Question 1 : Need to load the input Tissue Log csv to the output parent csv.

Fields are : PA#,Kit#,Lab,Patient Initials,Date Collected,Date Processed,Out of Body Time (approx.),Processed Time,Latency until processed,Location,Transporter	Processor,Tissue Type,# Formalin,# RNA Later,# Frozen,SNAP Frozen?,# Para- formaldehyde	A Specimen frozen right away	Formalin tubes remaining,RNA Later Used	Tube(s) used,Pieces remaining in used tube,RNA Later tubes Remaining,Frozen Used,Frozen Remaining	Quality?,Paraffin Block	H&E Slide,Frozen 1 weight,Frozen 2 weight,Frozen 3 Weight,Comments

The first output parent csv file will be as per the Requirement.Requirements are as below,

1)Add following fields to output CP Short Title,PPID,Visit Name,Visit Date,Specimen Label,Type,Tissue Type,Collection Date,Recived Date,Registration Date,Lineage
2)Add Constant CP Short Title as 'Demo CP',Type as 'Fresh Tissue' and Lineage as 'New'.
3)Concat Fields PPID and Visit Date and target field is 'Visit Name'.
4)Rename Kit# as Specimen Label, Date Collected as Collection Date.
5)Mapped Tissue Type as per given values.
6)Visit Date,Recived Date,Registration Date is same as Date Collected. 
7) All dates are must be in 'mm-dd-yyyy' format.
8)Create output CSV file.

Solution : 
1) First reads data from input CSV files into PDI using 'CSV File Input' transformation.

2) Add constant CP Short Title as 'Demo CP',Type as 'Fresh Tissue' and Lineage as 'New' using Add Constant Transformation.

3) Concat Fields PPID and Visit Date rename as Visit name using Concat Fields Transformation.

4) To change value of Tissue Type use Value Mapper Transformation.In that Gives field name and also source and target name of value.

5) Change fields name and add new fields using select values.

6) To change Date Format change format in text file output csv as 'MM-DD-YYYY'.

7) Load all the data from input CSV to the output CSV with by using 'Text Output' transformation.

8) Run the script and verified the count from input and output CSV also verified the changes in CSV.

Question 2 : Need to load the input Tissue Log csv to the output Derivative csv.

Fields are : PA#,Kit#,Lab,Patient Initials,Date Collected,Date Processed,Out of Body Time (approx.),Processed Time,Latency until processed,Location,Transporter	Processor,Tissue Type,# Formalin,# RNA Later,# Frozen,SNAP Frozen?,# Para- formaldehyde	A Specimen frozen right away	Formalin tubes remaining,RNA Later Used	Tube(s) used,Pieces remaining in used tube,RNA Later tubes Remaining,Frozen Used,Frozen Remaining	Quality?,Paraffin Block	H&E Slide,Frozen 1 weight,Frozen 2 weight,Frozen 3 Weight,Comments

The second output Derivative csv file will be as per the Requirement.Requirements are as below,

1)Add following fields to output CP Title,Parent Specimen,Specimen Label,Type,Created On,Lineage.
2)Add Constant CP Short Title as 'CP Demo',Type as Fixed Tissue, Frozen Tissue & RNA Tissue and Lineage as 'Derived'.
3)Add Specimen Label as if type is Fixed Tissue then concat kit# and '_FiT',if type is Frozen Tissue then concat kit# and '_FrT' and if type is RNA Tissue then concat kit# and '_RNA'.
4)Add Created On same as Date Collected.
5)Create output CSV file.

Solution : 
1) First reads data from input CSV files into PDI using 'CSV File Input' transformation.

2) Add constant CP Short Title as 'CP Demo',Type on the basis of  Type and Lineage as 'Derived' using Add Constant Transformation.

3) Create constant On basis of Type and the it is concat with Kit#.

4) Change fields name and add new fields using select values.

5) To change Date Format change format in text file output csv as 'MM-DD-YYYY'.

6) Load all the data from input CSV to the output CSV with by using 'Text Output' transformation.

7) Run the script and verified the count from input and output CSV also verified the changes in CSV.

Question 3 : Need to load the input Tissue Log csv to the output Aliquot csv.

Fields are : PA#,Kit#,Lab,Patient Initials,Date Collected,Date Processed,Out of Body Time (approx.),Processed Time,Latency until processed,Location,Transporter	Processor,Tissue Type,# Formalin,# RNA Later,# Frozen,SNAP Frozen?,# Para- formaldehyde	A Specimen frozen right away	Formalin tubes remaining,RNA Later Used	Tube(s) used,Pieces remaining in used tube,RNA Later tubes Remaining,Frozen Used,Frozen Remaining	Quality?,Paraffin Block	H&E Slide,Frozen 1 weight,Frozen 2 weight,Frozen 3 Weight,Comments

The third output Aliquot csv file will be as per the Requirement.Requirements are as below,

1)Add following fields to output CP Short Title,Parent Specimen Label,Specimen Label,Created On,Type,Class,Initial Quantity,Available Quantity,Lineage.

2)Add Constant CP Short Title as 'CP Demo',Type as Fixed Tissue, Frozen Tissue & RNA Tissue, Class as 'Tissue' and Lineage as 'Aliquot'.

3)Create rows as per value of #formalin For Fixed Tissue,#Frozen for Frozen Tissue and #RNA for RNA Tissue.

4)Add number in Specimen Number as per tissue type.

5)Add Created On same as Date Collected.

6)Create output CSV file.

Solution : 
1) First reads data from input CSV files into PDI using 'CSV File Input' transformation.

2) Add constant CP Short Title as 'CP Demo',Type on the basis of  Type,Class as 'Tissue' and Lineage as 'Derived' using Add Constant Transformation.

3)Create Cone of rows on the basis of #formalin,#Frozen and #RNA then append into one stream.

4) Change fields name and add new fields using select values.

5) To change Date Format change format in text file output csv as 'MM-DD-YYYY'.

6) Load all the data from input CSV to the output CSV with by using 'Text Output' transformation.

7) Run the script and verified the count from input and output CSV also verified the changes in CSV.
